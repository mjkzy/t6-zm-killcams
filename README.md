# bo2 t6 zm killcams
my zombie killcam mod that is unfinished. this may work off plutonium but this was only supported for plutonium in the first place.

## how killcam works
archive time is a variable that is set upon a player entity. you can revert it just like multiplayer (since zombies is just a mp copy and paste and has most of the same features) but setting to 0 after messing with it causes crashes. other than that, boom, you got kilcam

## compile
to compile, have a Compiler.exe + Irony.dll in the folder and just run ``gsc.bat``. there's a already compiled version, ``zm-killcams.gsc``. **NOT GUARRANTEED TO WORK**
